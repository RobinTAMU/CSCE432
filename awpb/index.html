        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Robin Dalela! I'm interested in this accessibility class because I think it is useful to make wesbites readily available for anyone to use.
            I think that focusing on accessibility not only makes using a website easier for those who need it, but also for people that don't need it. It's
            similar to how ramps are meant for wheelchair users, but they're useful for everyone. Here are some of my interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Math</li>
            <li>Video games (My favorite to play during breaks is <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank">league of legendse</a></li>
        </ul>
